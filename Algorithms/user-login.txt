    b. No - Display error and repeat 2.

    a. Yes - Go on to 4.
    b. No - Repeat 3.
4. Try to send username/password to user login endpoint
    a. If the endpoint cannot be contacted - Display error that the login couldn't be performed at this time.
        1. Add a line that tries to probe google/cloudflare dns. If it can't, show a message that the user looks to be offline. If it can, show a message that says the endpoint is having trouble right now.
